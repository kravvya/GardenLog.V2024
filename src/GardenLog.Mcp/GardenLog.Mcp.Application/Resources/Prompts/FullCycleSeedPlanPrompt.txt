# Task: Analyze Seed Plan for All Plants in Current Cycle

## Objective
Generate a comprehensive seeding analysis for the active harvest cycle:
1. Identify all plants in the current cycle
2. For each plant, calculate recommended seeding date based on historical data
3. Compare recommendations against planned dates
4. Highlight plants where adjustment is needed (difference > 2 days)
5. Provide actionable recommendations

## Workflow Reference
Follow the complete 8-step workflow defined in:
**Resource:** gardenlog://guides/full-cycle-seed-plan

## Key Requirements

### Data Quality Evaluation:
- Evaluate cycle notes for each plant (positive/neutral/negative outcomes)
- Weight recommendations toward dates with positive outcomes
- Flag plants with insufficient history (0-1 seasons)
- Handle multi-variety plants appropriately

### Comparison Logic:
- **Match Status:** Recommended date within ±2 days of planned date
- **Different Status:** Difference > 2 days (flag for attention)
- Calculate delta: recommended_date - planned_date (positive = later, negative = earlier)

### Output Format:
Provide two sections:

**Section 1: Summary Table**
| Plant | Planned Date | Recommended Date | Difference | Status | Rationale |
|-------|-------------|------------------|------------|--------|-----------|
[All plants listed]

**Section 2: Plants Needing Attention**
- Detailed breakdown of plants with "Different" status
- Explain why adjustment is recommended
- Provide historical context

### Rationale Guidelines:
Keep concise (1 line per plant):
- State data volume ("3 years @ [dates]")
- Mention key outcome ("100% germ", "strong yield")
- Flag sparse data ("Insufficient history", "1 year only")
- Note context ("Avoid shade beds")

## Expected Tool Calls
You will need to call these MCP tools:
1. get_current_harvest_cycle
2. get_harvest_cycle_plants (harvestCycleId from step 1)
3. For each plant:
   - get_plant_harvest_cycles (plantId, harvestCycleId)
   - get_worklog_history (plantId, reason="SowIndoors" or "SowOutside")

Refer to the resource guide for detailed workflow steps and data extraction patterns.

## Performance Notes
- Consider parallelizing per-plant calls if possible
- Focus on recent history (last 3 years) to reduce payload
- Use `includePlantVarieties: false` in step 2 to reduce initial payload (schedules still included)
- Provide progress updates if analyzing 15+ plants

## Edge Cases to Handle:
- No active harvest cycle - cannot proceed, inform user
- Plant not yet scheduled - show as "Not scheduled" status
- Significant date difference (>14 days) - flag as "Verify grow instructions"
- Negative outcomes dominate - suggest "Review" status

## Current Context
- Today's Date: Use current date for cycle resolution
- Scope: All plants in active harvest cycle

Begin the analysis now. Start by identifying the current harvest cycle.
