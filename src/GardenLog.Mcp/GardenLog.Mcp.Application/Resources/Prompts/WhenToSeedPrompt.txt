# Task: Analyze When to Seed {plantName}

## Objective
Provide a comprehensive seeding date recommendation for {plantName} by:
1. Finding the plant in the catalog
2. Analyzing the current harvest cycle's planned dates
3. Reviewing historical actual seeding dates
4. Evaluating outcome quality from past cycles
5. Generating a date recommendation with confidence level

## Workflow Reference
Follow the complete 7-step workflow defined in:
**Resource:** gardenlog://guides/when-to-seed

## Key Requirements

### Data Analysis:
- Do NOT rely solely on date frequency - evaluate outcome quality signals
- Prioritize dates with positive outcome notes (strong germination, good size, high yield)
- Flag or avoid dates with negative outcome notes (poor germination, small size, known issues)
- If outcomes are mixed, explain the context (e.g., "worked in full sun, not in shade")

### Output Format:
Provide a structured response with:
1. **Planned Date** - from current cycle schedule
2. **Historical Actual Dates** - last 2-3 seasons with day differences
3. **Outcome Quality Analysis** - summarize notes for each season (positive/negative/neutral)
4. **Recommended Date** - single date or narrow window
5. **Confidence Level** - High/Medium/Low based on data consistency and quality
6. **Rationale** - 1-2 sentences explaining the recommendation

### Edge Cases to Handle:
- No active harvest cycle - show baseline timing and historical pattern
- No historical data - note "first time growing" and suggest following planned date
- Multiple varieties with different dates - provide breakdown or ask for clarification
- Conflicting quality signals - call out explicitly with context

## Expected Tool Calls
You will need to call these MCP tools in sequence:
1. search_plants (plantName="{plantName}")
2. get_current_harvest_cycle
3. get_plant_details (plantId from step 1)
4. get_plant_harvest_cycles (plantId, harvestCycleId from step 2)
5. get_worklog_history (plantId, reason="SowIndoors" or "SowOutside")

Refer to the resource guide for detailed parameters and data extraction patterns.

## Current Context
- Today's Date: Use current date for cycle context
- Plant: {plantName}

Begin the analysis now.
